    <div class="Bio">
           
            <p>Born in Germany and grew up in Colorado. I've spent the last 12 years in South Florida. Growing up ive always had a passion for technology. As for many people life and responsibilities 
                    got in the way of following my passion. In my spare time I was able to self teach various coding languages and apply those skills to my businesses.</p> <p>Currently ive built out a few websites via wordpress while updating some websites that were written in custom code. This past year I was also learning and building out IOS applications with swift and xcode.
                    Im very excited to be starting a new chapter and completely immersing myself into the tech world and make the transition to full time developer.</p>
